# Mir Baqi Inscription: A Collaborative Scholarly Annotation Project

## Project Purpose
This repository hosts a detailed, version-controlled, and peer-reviewed annotation of the Mir Baqi inscription, a 16th-century Persian inscription from Ayodhya, India. The goal is to model a rigorous and transparent scholarly process for analyzing a contested historical source, establishing a baseline resource that can be built upon by other researchers.

## Methodology
The analysis follows the perspective of a historian/archaeologist specializing in Islamic architecture and its impact on urban planning in India. The methodology includes:

1. **Textual Analysis:** Critical examination of the inscription's language, script, and terminology.
2. **Architectural Comparison:** Contextualizing the inscription within the broader landscape of 16th-century Islamic architecture in the Indian subcontinent.
3. **Historical Contextualization:** Investigating the socio-political environment of the Mughal period and its influence on construction and commemoration.

## Disclaimer
This project acknowledges the highly contentious history of the Ayodhya site and the claims surrounding a Ram Temple. The analysis presented here does not seek to prove any particular narrative but aims to demonstrate how scholarly tools—such as philological scrutiny, architectural comparison, and transparent collaboration—can be applied to a sensitive historical source. All contributions are welcome, provided they adhere to academic standards of evidence and respectful discourse.

## Repository Structure
- `transcription.md`: Contains the inscription's original Persian script.
- `translation.md`: Provides a baseline English translation with notes.
- `analysis.md`: Scholarly interpretations and arguments (to be added).
- Issues and Pull Requests track scholarly debates and collaborative refinement.

## How to Contribute
1. Review the transcription and translation files.
2. Open an Issue to discuss points of ambiguity, linguistic nuance, or historical context.
3. Propose changes via Pull Requests, linking to relevant Issues.
4. Participate in peer review by commenting on PRs.
